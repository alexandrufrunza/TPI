        <p style="color: blue;">  Red pandas can be easily identified by their unique ruddy coat color, which acts like camouflage
             within the canopy of fir trees where branches are covered with clumps of reddish-brown moss and white lichens.They have
            large, round heads and short snouts with big, pointed ears. Their faces are white with reddish-brown “tear” marks that
            extend from the eyes to the corner of the mouth. These markings could have evolved to help keep the sun out of theireyes.
            Their tails are marked with alternating red and buff rings.Red pandas have a soft, dense woolly undercoatcovered by long,
            coarse guard hairs.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(202, 0, 0);">Long, bushy tails help these arboreal animals maintain balance and protectthem from harsh cold and
            winds. Dense fur completely covers their feet which have five, widely separated toes and semi-retractable claws. Red pandas
            scent-mark territories using anal glands and urine, as well as scent glands located between their footpads. These scent
            glands on the bottom of red pandas’ feet exude a colorless liquid that is odorless to humans. The red panda tests odors
            using the underside of its tongue, which has a cone-like structure for collecting liquid and bringing it close to a gland
            inside its mouth. It is the only carnivore with this adaptation.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(0, 195, 29);">Red pandas are the only living member of the Ailuridae family, and their taxonomic position has
             long been a subject of scientific debate. They were first described as members of the raccoon family (Procyonidae) — a controversial
            classification — in 1825, because of ecological characteristics and morphological similarities of the head, dentition and ringed tail.
            Later, due to some agreements in DNA, they were assigned to the bear family (Ursidae).Most recent genetic research, however, places
            red pandas in their own, independent family: Ailuridae.</p>

            Red Pandas Quack Like A Duck: While usually quiet creatures, red pandas make a variety of sounds
            including tweets, squeals, grunts, hisses, and even a "huff-quack"</blockquote>

            <p>Red pandas live in the rainy mountain forests of Nepal, India, Bhutan, northern Myanmar (Burma), and central China. 
            They spend the vast majority of their lives in trees, where they sleep and sunbathe.These animals have adapted incredibly
            well to their environment: They have sharp, semi-retractable claws that help them grip slippery branches, and their flexible
            ankles give them the unique ability to climb down trees headfirst.</p>

            <br> <br>
            <hr>
            <p>This helps them quickly escape predators like snow leopards and jackals, which may have difficulty seeing the animals
            to begin with: Their coats match the moss clumps that grow on their tree homes, and their black bellies make it difficult 
            for predators to spot them from the ground.Red pandas even have two layers of fur—a soft undercoat covered with coarse 
            hairs—to insulate them from the mountain chill, and they use their long tail as a wraparound blanket.</p>
